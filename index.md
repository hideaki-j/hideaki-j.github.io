# Short bio

Hideaki Joko is a research staff and PhD candidate at the Institute for Computer and Information Science, Radboud University, Netherlands. He received his MSc from the University of Tokyo for his research on natural language processing (NLP), and BEng in applied mathematics from Waseda University. He was a research engineer at Mitsubishi Electric Information and Technology R&D Center, Japan, from 2016 to 2020.

His research interests include information retrieval (IR) and NLP, and he has 6+ years research and 4+ years of hands-on experience in these fields.

He has published 10+ papers in conferences and the peer-reviewed journals, and filed several patents on IR and NLP algorithms and software. He received five awards including the incentive research award for his NLP research from the Japanese Society of Artificial Intelligence (JSAI) Workshop on Access and Visual Mining, and the Mitsubishi Electric R&D Center president award for making the design process efficient by developing an IR algorithm and software.
